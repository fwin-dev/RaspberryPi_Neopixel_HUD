# RaspberryPi_Neopixel_HUD
An experiment in using Neopixel interface as next generation HUD display

The opc.py and color_utils.py are from the openpixelcontrol library. I simply put them here for thoroughness when demoing with Meetup. I will eventually cleanse this repo and hint/point to get the proper libraries installed on host as this project matures. At this point it is standalone, but one should still obtain the openpixelcontrol repo and replace or properly install these files on the host.
